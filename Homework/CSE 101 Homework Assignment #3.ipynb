To translate a word into Pig Latin, take an English word, move the leading consonant to the end, followed by \"ay\" (e.g., \"tool\" becomes \"ooltay\"). If the word begins with a vowel, then simply add \"ay\" to the end (e.g., \"in\" -> \"inay\"). With that in mind, complete the function `pig_latin`, which takes a string of English words and translates them into Pig Latin. The function should return the result as a string. You should treat \"qu\" as a single consonant, and \"y\" should be treated as a vowel. Words are divided by spaces, and any non-alphabetic characters (like punctuation) inside a word should remain where they are. For example, `\"don't\"` becomes `\"on'tday\"` because the apostrophe is inside the word. For a punctuation mark at the end of a word, be sure to leave it where it is. For example, `'end.'` would become `'enday.'` Another example: `'true?'` becomes `'ruetay?'`. The only punctuation marks at the end of a word that you need to worry about are periods, commas, question marks and exclamation points. You may assume that at most one punctuation mark is at the end of a given word.
