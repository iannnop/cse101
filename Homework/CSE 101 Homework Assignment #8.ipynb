Various functions for working with regular expressions are available in the `re` module. Fortunately, Python makes it pretty easy to check if a string matches\n","a particular pattern.\n","\n","At the top of the Colab file we must import the `re` module:\n","\n","`import re`\n","\n","Then we can use the `search()` function to test whether a string matches a pattern. In the example below, the\n","regular expression has been saved in a string called `pattern` for convenience:\n","\n","```\n","phone = \"123-456-7890\"\n","pattern = r\"\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\"\n","if re.search(pattern, phone):\n","    print(\"The string matches the pattern.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"The string does not match the pattern.\")\n","```\n","\n","The `r` that precedes the pattern string is not a typo. Rather, the `r` indicates that the string is a \"raw\" string. In a raw string, as opposed to a \"normal\" string, any backslash character is interpreted as simply a backslash, as opposed to defining an escape sequence like `\\n` or `\\t`. Make sure you use raw strings in your Python code when defining regular expressions.\n","\n","The `ˆ` and `$` at the respective beginning and end of the regular expression indicate that the entire string must match the regular expression, and not just part of the string. Make sure you include these symbols in your regular\n","expressions too!\n","\n","You can play around with regular expressions on this web-based platform: [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6EP0KSeaWkVg","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Part 1: Phone Number Checker (20 points)\n","\n","Write a function `phone_number()` that takes one parameter, which is a list of strings, each being a potential phone number.
