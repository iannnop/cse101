But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \\\\n\\\\n///\\\\n\\\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \\\\n\\\\n///\\\\n\\\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \\\\n\\\\n///\\\\n\\\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
